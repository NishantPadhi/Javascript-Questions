/**
*
Given a list of strings, implement a function listFormat that returns the items concatenated into a single string. A common use case would be in summarizing the reactions for social media posts.

The function should support a few options as the second parameter:

sorted: Sorts the items by alphabetical order.
length: Show only the first length items, using "and X other(s)" for the remaining. Ignore invalid values (negative, 0, etc).
unique: Remove duplicate items.
