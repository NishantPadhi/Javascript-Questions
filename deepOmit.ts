/**
 * Implement a function deepOmit(obj, keys) that removes specified keys and their corresponding values from an object, 
 * including nested objects or arrays. It works recursively to traverse through the entire object structure, 
 * ensuring that all occurrences of the specified keys are removed at all levels. The function takes in an object (obj) 
 * and an array of string keys (keys).
