/**
 *
In Type Utilities, we have implemented utility functions to determine the types of primitive values. 
In this question, we will implement the following utility functions to determine the types of non-primitive values.

isArray(value): Return true if value is an array, false otherwise.
isFunction(value): Return true if value is a function, false otherwise.
isObject(value): Return true if value is an object (e.g. arrays, functions, objects, etc, 
but not including null and undefined), false otherwise.
isPlainObject(value): Return true if value is a plain object, false otherwise (for arrays, functions, etc).
A plain object, or what is commonly known as a Plain Old JavaScript Object (POJO) is any object whose prototype 
is Object.prototype or an object created via Object.create(null).
