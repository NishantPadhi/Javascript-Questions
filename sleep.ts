In JavaScript, the setTimeout function can be used to execute callbacks after a delay. However, it introduces a layer of nesting in the code which may not be desired. It'd be nice to use setTimeout in this fashion:


// Note: the following code contains invalid syntax and doesn't work.
console.log('Hello!');
setTimeout(1000);
console.log('Bye.');
