/**
 * Implement a JavaScript function intersection(arrays) that takes multiple

 * The order of values in the returned array are determined by the first array.

/** Examples
 *
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [2, 3, 4];
const arr3 = [3, 4, 5];

intersection(arr1, arr2, arr3); // => [3]

const arr4 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 7];
intersection(arr4); // [1, 5, 7, 9]
