/**
 * JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means the types of variable can be changed during runtime. 
 * Many interview questions involve recursion of values that contain values of different types and 
 * how to handle each value type (e.g. different code is needed to iterate over an array vs an object). 
 * Knowledge of handling the JavaScript types is crucial to solving questions like Deep Clone and Deep Equal.
